# California Housing Prices Machine Learning Model
 
I created a tensorflow machine learning neural network trained on a [kaggle dataset] (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahmedshahriarsakib/usa-real-estate-dataset?select=realtor-data.zip.csv) that provided data collected from (https://www.realtor.com/). The dataset consisted of the following categories:
- brokered by (categorically encoded agency/broker)
- status (Housing status - a. ready for sale or b. ready to build)
- price (Housing price, it is either the current listing price or recently sold price if the house is sold recently)
- bed (# of beds)
- bath (# of bathrooms)
- acre_lot (Property / Land size in acres)
- street (categorically encoded street address)
- city (city name)
- state (state name)
- zip_code (postal code of the area)
- house_size (house area/size/living space in square feet)
- prev_sold_date (Previously sold date)
